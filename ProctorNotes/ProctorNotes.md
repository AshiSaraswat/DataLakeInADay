# Proctor Notes

## Introduction

These notes are aimed at people running the workshop for a day. They should help you to guide the day to meet expectations and cover the right products, as well as keep the day moving and plan for timing and breaks.

## Schedule

09:00 - arrive and breakfast
09:30 - Set up infrastructure (deploy takes ~14 minutes)
10:00 - Session 1 (starts as soon as deploy begins)
10:30 - **Coffee Break**
11:00 - Lab 1 ()
12:00 - **Lunch**
13:00 - Lab 2
14:00 - Session 2
14:30 - **Coffee Break**
15:00 - Lab 3a or Lab 3b
16:00 - Lab 4
17:00 - Lab 5 (Loading to Power BI is generally low priority so drop if short of time)

## Labs

The infrastructure is all hard coded so should not present any unusual problems. The password is **demogod** and it's advisable to suggest to the class to enter "Password123$" as their password when deploying - write this on a whiteboard to help them, but be sure to note it's not secure and that the demo subscription will be removed at the end of the day.
