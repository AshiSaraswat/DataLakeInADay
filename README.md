# Data Lake in a Day

## Introduction
This repository contains workshops and content for the data lake in a day engagement. While this is designed around the classroom and MTC, there is no reason you shouldn't work through the demos yourself at any time to gain an understanding of the platform.

The below image shows an overview of the platform components we will be using during the day.
